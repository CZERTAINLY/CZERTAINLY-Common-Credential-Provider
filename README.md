Common Credential Provider is the implementation of basic `Credential` `Kinds` and validation interfaces. This `Connector` provides options to add the `Credential` to the `Core` which can be used within other objects in the platform for authentication and authorization purposes.

> `Credentials` provided by the Common Credential Provider are not involved in
the platform authentication and authorization process.

Common Credential Provider implement the following credential `Kinds`:
- Basic (Username and Password)
- API Key
- Software KeyStore (i.e., certificate related authentication)

## Short Process Description

The `Credential` can be created and added to the `Core` based on their `Kind`. Selecting the specific `Kind` of `Credential` and providing the necessary information is the first step in the process.  When the `Connector` or other platform object requests the specific `Kind` of the `Credential` implemented in this `Credential Provider`, it will provide its values.

To know more about the `Core`, refer to [CZERTAINLY Core](https://github.com/CZERTAINLY/CZERTAINLY-Core).

## Interfaces

Common Credential Provider implements the `Credential Provider` Interface from the CZERTAINLY Interfaces. To learn more about the interfaces and end points, refer to the [CZERTAINLY Interfaces](https://github.com/CZERTAINLY/CZERTAINLY-Interfaces).

For more information regarding the `Credentials`, please refer to the [CZERTAINLY documentation](https://docs.czertainly.com).
